Sainz also competed in the UK Formula Renault Winter Cup, finishing 6th in the first race and retiring from the second race at Snetterton.</p>

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>Born in Madrid, Sainz is the son of two-time World Rally Champion Carlos Sainz. Graduating from karti ng to junior formulae in 2010, Sainz won his first championship at the Formula Renault NEC in 2011 with Koiranen, finishing runner-up to Robin Frijns in the Eurocup that year.
                 In 2012, Sainz contested British Formula 3, the Formula 3 Euro Series and FIA European Formula 3 with Carlin. Sainz progressed to the GP3 Series with Arden in 2013, finishing tenth in his rookie season. He then found success in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, winning the championship in 2014 with DAMS.
                 A member of the Red Bull Junior Team since 2010, Sainz signed with Toro Rosso in 2015, debuting alongside Max Verstappen. He remained at Toro Rosso until the 2017 United States Grand Prix, where he replaced Jolyon Palmer at Renault, having already signed with the team from 2018 onwards. Sainz moved to McLaren in 2019, ending his association with Red Bull. 
                 He took his maiden podium at the Brazilian Grand Prix that year, followed by another at the Italian Grand Prix in 2020. Sainz signed for Ferrari in 2021, replacing Sebastian Vettel to partner Charles Leclerc. After a winless debut season for Ferrari, Sainz took his maiden pole position and win at the British Grand Prix in 2022. He took further wins for Ferrari at Singapore in 2023, as well as Australia and Mexico City in 2024.
                 Replaced by Lewis Hamilton for 2025, Sainz joined Williams to partner Alexander Albon, claiming a podium at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
                 As of the 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Sainz has achieved four race wins, six pole positions, four fastest laps and 28 podiums in Formula One. Sainz is contracted to remain at Williams until at least the end of the 2026 season.In 2013, Sainz signed with Arden to compete in the GP3 series. During the first qualifying session of the year, he qualified in 5th place, 5 tenths off of pole sitter Kevin Korjus. However, he, as well as Alex Fontana and Patrick Kujala, were penalised 10 places for ignoring yellow flags during free practice. During the beginning of race one, Sainz got up to 13th place by passing Alex Fontana and Jimmy Eriksson off the start. By the start of lap 3, he was 13 seconds behind the leader. Sainz made it up to 8th place with his teammate Daniil Kvyat until both cars lacked grip. Because they were both pushing to get into the top ten for points, neither driver decided to manage their Pirelli tyres and so by the end of the race, Kvyat was 20th and Sainz was 15th. He finished 51 seconds off first placed man Tio Ellinas.

Sainz started in 15th place for race 2 on Sunday morning. At the end of lap 1, he was in 9th place. As they approached lap 2, the safety car was deployed due to an accident behind, giving Sainz time to save his tyres. With 5 laps remaining, Sainz was up to 8th place. During the next lap, he put a move on Jack Harvey's ART car to move up into 7th place. Sainz eventually would finish in 7th place. However, post race investigating revealed that Sainz's car was underweight, so he was disqualified from the final results from race 2, thus scoring no points. His teammate, Kvyat, retired during the race due to contact with another driver.

In Valencia, Sainz began, and finished, the race in 8th place. In race 2, he started in 4th place and got up to 3rd place by the end of lap 1. He remained in that position, scoring a podium for the first time in GP3. Sainz obtained 24 world championship points, 4 for fastest laps in both races. He was now in 6th place in the championship overall.

During the first race in Silverstone, Sainz was squeezed off track, falling to 9th place. By mid distance, Sainz overtook Lewis Williamson to get into 8th place. Williamson then moved alongside Sainz to try and overtake but Sainz kept moving over towards him until there was contact. Williamson was sent into a spin whilst Sainz continued to circulate round the track. Due to the damage to his car, Sainz fell down the order until he crossed the finish line in 13th place. In race 2, he finished where he started, in 13th place.
Sainz raced in Formula Renault 3.5 for the first time in 2013.[6] However, he missed several races in his first season[7] most likely due to his commitment towards GP3. In Monaco, he finished 6th place, most probably due to a challenging start to his GP3 season. He then experienced a double retirement in Spa. He also missed the races in Moscow and Austria. However, he made a comeback in Hungary, securing a 7th-place finish in Race 1. In Race 2, he faced several issues and finished in 22nd place. In France, at the Circuit de Paul Ricard, he had another double retirement. In the last race weekend of the year in Catalunya, he retired in race 1 but managed to score 6th place.

In 2014, he switched teams to DAMS. In the season opener at Monza, he finished 18th in the first race but won the second. He left Monza with 25 points, beating his previous seasons' score by 3 points. Another win at Aragon meant he doubled his score and in race 2, he finished in 4th. Another 4th place followed at the one race in Monaco. The weekend at Spa followed with another 2 wins. Moscow followed. 14th and 6th meant that he only took 8 points from a possible 50. At the Nürburgring GP Circuit, he won race 1 but in race 2, he retired. In Hungary, he was no match for Roberto Merhi who led by half a minute from the rest of the field in the wet. Another 6th place followed in race 2. In France, he won and scored a total of 50 points to extend his championship lead over Merhi.

He qualified inside the top ten for his debut, the Australian Grand Prix, and finished the race in ninth position.[14] He scored points again at the Malaysian Grand Prix, but failed to score at the Chinese Grand Prix after spinning and then retired from the Bahrain Grand Prix with a wheel issue. He qualified fifth at the Spanish Grand Prix, his highest grid position of the year, and finished the race ninth. He was forced to start the Monaco Grand Prix from the pit lane after failing to attend the weigh-bridge during qualifying. He recovered to tenth place in the race.[15]

Four consecutive retirements began with electrical failures at the Austrian and British Grands Prix, then a fuel pressure issue at the Hungarian Grand Prix and a power unit issue at the Belgian Grand Prix. A 150 km/h and 46 g impact into the barriers during practice for the Russian Grand Prix resulted in Sainz spending the night in hospital.[16] He missed qualifying but was declared fit to race, however he failed to finish after a brake failure.[17] He crashed in qualifying for the United States Grand Prix and started from last place, but gained ten positions on the first lap and went on to record his best finish of the year with seventh place. Sainz finished his debut season fifteenth in the Drivers' Championship, scoring 18 points to teammate Verstappen's 49.[18]
