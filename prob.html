                <p>In a 2011 interview, screenwriter Stewart Stern recounted that Newman drew on an incident from his Navy years as an "emotional trigger to express the character's trauma" when acting in the 1956 film The Rack. He said that Newman thought back to an incident in which his best friend was sliced to pieces on an aircraft carrier by a plane's propeller.</p>

                <h3>Newman in 1954</h3>
                <p>Newman's first film for Hollywood was The Silver Chalice (1954), co-starring Italian actress Pier Angeli. The film was a box-office failure, and the actor would later acknowledge his disdain for it.[34] In 1956, Newman garnered much attention and acclaim for the role of Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise's biographical film Somebody Up There Likes Me.[35] That year, he also played the lead in Arnold Laven's The Rack.[36] In 1957, Newman worked again with director Wise in Until They Sail.[37] Also that year, he acted in Michael Curtiz's The Helen Morgan Story.</p>

                <h3>Newman in <a href="#">The Hustler</a> (1961)</h3>
                <p>In 1961, Newman starred in Robert Rossen's The Hustler. The film, which was based on a book of the same name by Walter Tevis, tells the story of small-time pool hustler "Fast Eddie" Felson (Newman) who challenges a legendary pool player portrayed by Jackie Gleason. The film was a critical and financial hit. Newman won both the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award and the Argentinian Film Festival Best Actor awards. He was also nominated for the same prize at that year's Academy Awards.[45] Stanley Kauffmann, writing for The New Republic, praised the principal cast, calling Newman "first-rate".</p>
